# Code style

Run `zig fmt` on Zig source files before committing them. Apply the following
rules to handwritten Zig code.

## Imports

Place imports and aliases derived from imports at the bottom of the file, after
type and function declarations.

Group them in this order, with a blank line between groups:

1. Zig standard library imports and aliases.
2. Third-party imports.
3. Project imports.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const Writer = std.Io.Writer;

const casez = @import("casez");

const Config = @import("Config.zig");
```

## Tests

Group handwritten test declarations at file scope, after production declarations
and immediately before the final imports and aliases. Do not interleave tests
with production declarations or nest them in types. This rule applies to actual
handwritten tests, not Zig source text emitted by code generators.

## Initialization

When a variable has a named type, put the type on the left-hand side and use an
inferred initializer on the right-hand side.

```zig
var output: Writer.Allocating = .init(allocator);
var writer: CodeWriter = .init(&output.writer);
var imports: Imports = .empty;
```

Do not repeat the type on the right-hand side when inference is clear:

```zig
var output = Writer.Allocating.init(allocator);
```

## Type conversion initializers

When an enum, tagged union, or other type owns a conversion from another project
or API type, put the converter on the destination type and name it like an
initializer, for example `fromUtilityFunction`. This keeps the conversion close
to the type it creates and matches the idiomatic Zig pattern used throughout the
codebase.

```zig
pub const TypeSelectedScalar = enum {
    none,
    float,
    int,

    pub fn fromUtilityFunction(function: GodotApi.UtilityFunction) TypeSelectedScalar {
        // Convert external metadata into this enum.
    }
};
```

Prefer this over a free helper such as `typeSelectedScalar(function)` when the
function's purpose is to construct or select that type.
